 this command use to check the git version in system PS C:\Users\AC\Desktop> git --version

it define the user name and email in future when we use the guthub

for creating the clone of git file in our computer we use the command

 git clone https://github.com/shubhlodhi/shubhlodhi.git

this http link https://github.com/shubhlodhi/shubhlodhi.git came from the git respository code section part help to  create the clone

we use "git status" command for checking the status of git folder

suppose we check the file in git folder or system folder we use command "ls"

or we check the hidden file on the folder use "ls -a"

we want to go to specific folder use "cd "nameoffolder" "


we also change the gut file on remote/website file from our local system 

first we change the file through our system and then we run command

" git add"  add means commit/save the update file on the git repo on GitHub 
and check with the help git status command

and in last we commit the change we apply in git file :
using git commit -m "nameofcommituapply"

by run this command the git file on GitHub will change successfully
and in last run "gut push  origin main" command for lastly push the file to origin (git file) on main branche of git repo on GitHub

now suppose we want to add new file from the system to git and it is not listed in git repo it shows sign of U means untraced

create a new file in system folder and run "git add "nameoffile""
